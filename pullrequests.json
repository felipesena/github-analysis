There are a couple major advantages of this refactor, and future work will be built on top of it.\r\n\r\nFirst, we will no longer have multiple navigations running at the same time. Previously, a new navigation wouldn't cause the old navigation to be cancelled and cleaned up. Instead, multiple navigations could be going at once, and we imperatively checked that we were operating on the most current `router.navigationId` as we progressed through the Observable streams. This had some major faults, the biggest of which was async races where an ongoing async action could result in a redirect once the async action completed, but there was no way to guarantee there weren't also other redirects that would be queued up by other async actions. After this refactor, there's a single Observable stream that will get cleaned up each time a new navigation is requested.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the individual pieces of routing have been pulled out into their own operators. While this was needed in order to create one continuous stream, it also will allow future improvements to the testing APIs as things such as Guards or Resolvers should now be able to be tested in much more isolation.\r\n\r\n* Add the new `router.transitions` observable of the new `NavigationTransition` type to contain the transition information\r\n* Update `router.navigations` to pipe off of `router.transitions`\r\n* Re-write navigation Observable flow to a single configured stream\r\n* Refactor `switchMap` instead of the previous `mergeMap` to ensure new navigations cause a cancellation and cleanup of already running navigations\r\n* Wire in existing error and cancellation logic so cancellation matches previous behavior", "created_at": "2018-08-30T06:44:54Z", "updated_at": "2018-09-18T04:05:24Z", "close_at": null, "merged_at": null}, {"id": 211887184, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/pulls/25734", "number": 25734, "state": "open", "title": "docs-infra: ngmodule pages", "body": "", "created_at": "2018-08-29T21:05:38Z", "updated_at": "2018-09-13T23:12:49Z", "close_at": null, "merged_at": null}, {"id": 211886212, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/pulls/25732", "number": 25732, "state": "open", "title": "Integrate i18n material from CLI wiki", "body": "## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n```\r\n[ ] Bugfix\r\n[ ] Feature\r\n[ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n[ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n[ ] Build related changes\r\n[ ] CI related changes\r\n[x] Documentation content changes\r\n[ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n[ ] Other...

However, if the value stored is falsy (ie. `false`, `0`, `''`, etc) the child view will not be rendered. This can be problematic if the stored value is required to be displayed, or provided as an argument to an output or DOM event.\r\n\r\n`ngLet` works around this issue by always rendering the child view, regardless of the result of its expression.\r\n\r\n### Semantic meaning\r\n\r\nEven in the cases where `ngIf` works, some semantic meaning is lost. Reading the code doesn't communicate whether the auther intended contitional rendering or simply needed to expose the result of the expression to its child view.\r\n\r\n`ngLet` explicitly communicates semantic meaning, illustrating that the intent of the author's code was to expose the result of the expression, not conditional rendering.\r\n\r\n### Syntax\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div *ngLet=\"condition as value\">{{value}}</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n```\r\n[ ] Yes\r\n[x] No\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nN/A", "created_at": "2018-08-14T01:33:58Z", "updated_at": "2018-08-21T07:57:33Z", "close_at": null, "merged_at": null}, {"id": 207906847, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/pulls/25451", "number": 25451, "state": "open", "title": "fix(common): return correct week of year number for date pipe", "body": "## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n```\r\n[x] Bugfix\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n[ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) states that weeks should start with a monday.

Trying to use `[routerLink]=\"'http://example.com'\"` throws an error because this route doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-basic-template-d1fbu6?file=src/app/hello.component.ts\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nThis PR allows using external URLs (URL starting with `http://` or `https://`) to be used inside both `routerLink` and `[routerLink]` for `<a>` tags and all other tags. This also includes support for `queryParams` and `fragment` bindings.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<a routerLink=\"https://example.com\">link</a>\r\n// https://example.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"['https://example.com']\" [queryParams]=\"{q: '1'}\" fragment=\"f\">link</a>\r\n// https://example.com?q=1#f\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n<a [routerLink]=\"['https://example.com', 'foo', 'bar']\" [queryParams]=\"{q: '1', w: 2}\" fragment=\"f\">link</a>\r\n// https://example.com/foo/bar?q=1&w=2#f\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same works with other tags such as `<button>`.\r\n\r\nI should explain some implementation decisions I made because with some things I couldn't make up my mind what would be the best approach.\r\n\r\nBoth `routerLink` classes had previously access only to `LocationStrategy` (`PathLocationStrategy` or `HashLocationStrategy`) but when I want to open en external link it should be unrelated to `LocationStrategy`. That's why I added `goExternal` into `Location` because that's what I'd call from a component or service for example instead of using `Router` (external links should be independent on the router I'm using).\r\n\r\nI also updated `BrowserPlatformLocation` and let `pushState()` handle external URLs and didn't add a new method for this purpose. I think its up to `PlatformLocation` to decide how to handle external URLs similarly to what it does now with `hash` in `BrowserPlatformLocation`.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n```\r\n[ ] Yes\r\n[X] No\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nI didn't want to update docs until I have approval from somebody competent that these changes make sense.", "created_at": "2018-06-28T16:45:05Z", "updated_at": "2018-07-30T21:40:03Z", "close_at": null, "merged_at": null}, {"id": 197794216, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/pulls/24692", "number": 24692, "state": "open", "title": "Update upgrade.md with new preparation guide.", "body": "Add an outline for upgrade file and preparation section.

Since it's marked with `@Host()` it will look only to the host element of the current component which is `AppNumbersComponent` that doesn't provide any `SelectControlValueAccessor`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/9dd647b0879544015dec14fc8f8d5ee1cc16066d/packages/forms/src/directives/select_control_value_accessor.ts#L173-L177\r\n\r\nThis caused `NgSelectOption` to never be assigned to any `SelectControlValueAccessor` and therefore they never updated their parent `<select>` (I'm not sure if this had some other consequences that aren't covered by tests):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/9dd647b0879544015dec14fc8f8d5ee1cc16066d/packages/forms/src/directives/select_control_value_accessor.ts#L188-L191\r\n\r\nInterestingly this worked when updating form control value after the `<option>`'s were added because of this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular/blob/9dd647b0879544015dec14fc8f8d5ee1cc16066d/packages/forms/src/directives/select_control_value_accessor.ts#L127\r\n\r\nThat same problem was with multi-selects (`NgSelectMultipleOption`).\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nI only removed `@Host()` decorators and added tests (these tests would fail with `@Host()`). Now `NgSelectOption`s correctly update their parent `<select>` right in their constructor because they aren't looking only to the host component.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n```\r\n[ ] Yes\r\n[X] No\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis shouldn't be a breaking change because I think it's very unlikely anybody was relying to the previous behaviour.\r\n", "created_at": "2018-06-11T12:19:54Z", "updated_at": "2018-07-31T22:15:48Z", "close_at": null, "merged_at": null}, {"id": 193767545, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/pulls/24391", "number": 24391, "state": "open", "title": "fix(angular-elements): exact version for document-register-element", "body": "## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n```\r\n[ x] Bugfix\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\nBreaking change of document-register-element package\r\n\r\nIssue Number: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/24390\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nFixed version will keep working.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n```\r\n[ ] Yes\r\n[x ] No\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n", "created_at": "2018-06-09T09:13:22Z", "updated_at": "2018-07-30T21:39:57Z", "close_at": null, "merged_at": null}, {"id": 193608003, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/pulls/24375", "number": 24375, "state": "open", "title": "docs(aio): Update Universal/SSR guide to align with current CLI", "body": "## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n```\r\n[ ] Bugfix\r\n[ ] Feature\r\n[ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n[ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n[ ] Build related changes\r\n[ ] CI related changes\r\n[x] Documentation content changes\r\n[ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n[ ] Other...

The current regex *does not work* if the generated code is a little more complicated, like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction FooComponent () {\r\n    __super.apply(this, __tslib.__spread(arguments));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nRather than try to make this regex cover all possible permutations of this pattern, can we instead determine if a constructor is implicit by inspecting metadata alone?\r\n\r\nThis change relies on the following:\r\n\r\n- `tsc` does not emit `design:paramtypes` metadata for types with implicit constructors\r\n- this change to `tsickle` ensures the same for tsickle code: https://github.com/angular/tsickle/pull/760\r\n\r\nIf a constructor function does not provide constructor parameter metadata and reports no explicit arguments, then we attempt to inherit constructor parameters from the parent type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n```\r\n[X] Yes\r\n[ ] No\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\n**Edit:** I have a work around for this issue described here in the form of the `_isInjectable` check, which tries to determine if a type has been prepared for injection in *some* way before trying to determine the parameter list.\r\n\r\nThis change works for all code currently in the `./test.sh node` test suite, though it may be working \"accidentally\" for some types. This is because it **does not** work correctly with the following pattern:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n@Injectable()\r\nclass BaseClass {\r\n    constructor (public data: string) {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// NOTE: no attribute to trigger metadata generation\r\nclass Foo extends BaseClass {\r\n    constructor () {\r\n        super('hello');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpecifically, attempting to inject a non-attributed class which inherits from an attributed class.\r\n\r\nBecause the class `Foo` does not have any attributes, it does not get any constructor metadata and so looks like it could be a \"pass-through\" constructor. The super class *does* have constructor metadata,\r\nso the routine incorrectly uses that parameter list.\r\n\r\n`Foo` is technically incorrectly declared - it should have the `@Injectable()` attribute, however because it does not we determine that the parameter set for `Foo` is `[string]` and the code eventually fails with the following unhelpful error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNullInjectorError: No provider for String!\r\n```", "created_at": "2018-03-08T01:48:43Z", "updated_at": "2018-07-30T21:39:28Z", "close_at": null, "merged_at": null}, {"id": 172690652, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/pulls/22575", "number": 22575, "state": "open", "title": "fix(forms): handle form groups/arrays own pending async validation", "body": "introduce a boolean to track form groups/arrays own pending async validation to distinguish between pending state due to children and pending state due to own validation\r\n\r\nFixes #10064\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n```\r\n[x] Bugfix\r\n[ ] Feature\r\n[ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n[ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n[ ] Build related changes\r\n[ ] CI related changes\r\n[ ] Documentation content changes\r\n[ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n[ ] Other...

Even though removing form directive from DOM does not destroy `FormControl` instance it should destroy connection between `FormControl` and corresponding value accessor, which it created. \r\n\r\nFirst issue with the current behavior is that it keeps sending values to value accessors, which were destroyed. The practical example of this is described in the linked issue: `ValueAccessor.writeValue()` is called multiple times although all except the newest one were destroyed.\r\n\r\nSecond issue is that it creates a memory leak. Because connection between control and destroyed value accessor is never cleaned up, it retains destroyed value accessor directives/components and associated DOM nodes until `FormControl` itself is garbage-collected.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nWhen `FormControlDirective` is destroyed it will clean up connection between `FormControl` and value accessor, which was created by the directive.\r\n\r\nWhen `FormControlDirective.control` is changed it will clean up connection between old `FormControl` and value accessor, which was created by the directive.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n```\r\n[x] Yes (well, if somebody was relying on current undocumented behavior... which I hope they didn't)\r\n[ ] No\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n", "created_at": "2018-02-28T21:05:36Z", "updated_at": "2018-07-30T21:39:27Z", "close_at": null, "merged_at": null}, {"id": 171543508, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/pulls/22465", "number": 22465, "state": "open", "title": "fix(compiler): collapse whitespace before scanning for CSS rules", "body": "## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n```\r\n[X] Bugfix\r\n[ ] Feature\r\n[ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n[ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n[ ] Build related changes\r\n[ ] CI related changes\r\n[ ] Documentation content changes\r\n[ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n[ ] Other...

Please describe:\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\nThe `NgSelectOption` directive of the `forms` package is always applied to `option` elements regardless of whether they are used in a corresponding form. In its `value` binding it unconditionally sets the `value` attribute of the underlying native element, i.e. even if the `option` is not used as part of a form the `value` will be set. Every other code in that directive that performs any action is protected by a guard that checks for the presence of parent select control value accessor.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour leads to issues when any of the forms modules are imported in a module that uses another library or custom directive which interacts with the `value` attribute of the native element (see [this issue](https://github.com/MrWolfZ/ngrx-forms/issues/32) as an example for how this behavior interferes with my `ngrx-forms` library).\r\n\r\nIssue Number: N/A\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\nThe new behavior is to extend the guard that checks for the presence of parent select control value accessor to also prevent the directive from modifying the native element's value if no accessor is present.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n```\r\n[ ] Yes\r\n[x] No\r\n```\r\n", "created_at": "2018-02-03T10:55:38Z", "updated_at": "2018-07-30T21:39:17Z", "close_at": null, "merged_at": null}, {"id": 166884337, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/pulls/21998", "number": 21998, "state": "open", "title": "Changes and fixes to the new animations guide", "body": "", "created_at": "2018-02-02T19:29:40Z", "updated_at": "2018-07-30T21:39:17Z", "close_at": null, "merged_at": null}, {"id": 166313192, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/pulls/21936", "number": 21936, "state": "open", "title": "fix(http): need ability to flush bool in http test", "body": "The flush method in TestRequest can return a boolean as this is a valid\r\njson response.\r\n\r\nCloses #20690\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [X ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n```\r\n[X ] Bugfix\r\n[ ] Feature\r\n[ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n[ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n[ ] Build related changes\r\n[ ] CI related changes\r\n[ ] Documentation content changes\r\n[ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n[ ] Other...

Please describe:\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying, or link to a relevant issue. -->\r\n\r\nIn #19006 a fix was implemented to properly delay the removal of nested animations in distinct components if they are queried in a parent's leave animation using `animateChild`. Upon testing the new behavior I found that the problem occurs once again for deeper nested components.  The problem can be observed [in this Plunker](https://plnkr.co/edit/PRtU3JBgoZKuhDAO0wgl?p=preview).\r\n\r\nAfter an intense debugging session I discovered that this is caused by the fact that the inner animation is not considered as child animation of the parent's leave transition but as a root animation in itself.  As such, the parent's leave transition does not wait for the supposed child animation to complete and causes the node to be removed immediately.\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nQueried elements in a parent leave animation are now always considered as sub-animation of that parent's animation by assuring proper ordering of transition namespaces.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n```\r\n[ ] Yes\r\n[x] No\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications below. -->\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nWhen including a component in a template, the component's host element is immediately appended as child of the parent node upon creation. Hence, `hostElement.parentNode` will be a valid reference.  However, if the parent component is being inserted as an embedded view---through `ngIf` for example---then the parent's node itself will not have been insterted yet. This means that we cannot properly determine the position of the transition namespace, as any `containsElement` check will return false given that the partial DOM tree has not been inserted yet, even though it will be contained within an existing transition namespace once the partial tree is attached.  This PR ensures that the registration of the transition namespace is queued if the element is not yet attached with the body node.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the incorrect ordering of transition namespaces, the leave transition on the parent using `animateChild` was unable to select the child transition as it had not been processed yet.  In the end, this causes the child animation not be considered as nested transition within the parent player, but as a separate root player of its own.\r\n\r\nIn the test, it is required to inspect the players of the `AnimationEngine` and not those from `getLog`.  The latter only returns the actual animation players, of which the parent leave animation is not part of given that it does not have animation instructions of its own.\r\n\r\nI have tried a fix where the registration of transition namespaces is always queued, however that causes several tests regarding `:enter` transitions to fail, along with two computed style tests for pre- and post animation styles.  I did not look into why exactly this happens but opted to go with the current solution.\r\n", "created_at": "2017-10-22T13:51:25Z", "updated_at": "2018-08-07T20:21:38Z", "close_at": null, "merged_at": null}, {"id": 147807615, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/pulls/19829", "number": 19829, "state": "open", "title": "feat(forms): expose updateTreeValidity method", "body": "## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n```\r\n[ ] Bugfix\r\n[x] Feature\r\n[ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n[ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n[ ] Build related changes\r\n[ ] CI related changes\r\n[ ] Documentation content changes\r\n[ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n[ ] Other...

Please describe:\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What is the current behavior?\r\nGuards doesn't behave the same way towards multivalued and infinite Observables : \r\n- `canActivate`, `canDeactive` and `canActivateChild` will only check the first value emitted and won't wait for observables to complete.\r\n- `canLoad` will check all the values returned and wait until all observables complete.\r\n- `resolve` will only keep the last value emitted by each observable and wait until all observable complete.\r\n\r\nGuards will behave the same way and act nicely towards single value observable that complete immediately after its emission. But not when more complicated Observables are used, I think `canActivate`, `canDeactivated` and `canActivateChild` behavior is the right one, meaning converting any observable into a single value observable that complete right after its emission. \r\nThis is done through the use of the `first` operator.\r\n\r\nThks to @trotyl I think I got the history of this : \r\n\r\nInitially guards would use all values emitted by observables meaning boolean guards applied a logical and on every emits while resolve was just overwriting the value (so only last emit was kept). Then this pr #10412 changed `canActivate`, `canDeactivated` and `canActivateChild` to resolve at first value but didn't change `canLoad` nor `resolve` that's why we now have inconsistency between guards.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #18991\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nI did 2 things : \r\n1) Use `first()` operator on observable inside `wrapIntoObservable()`. The idea is that when we have a signature that accepts observable, promise and values we are expecting the output observable to only emit one value. Converting a value or a promise into an Observable already produces a single emit Observable so we just need to convert Observable (which can be of any kind) into single emit Observable.\r\n2) Create a common helper function `runGuards()` to be used by all guards so we get consistency. This function basically takes guards tokens as input and return an observable that'll emit each corresponding guard output.\r\n\r\n1 will also affects `loadChildren` on route but I think it's safe because same logic should apply.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n```\r\n[X] Yes\r\n[] No\r\n```\r\nAs mentioned by @Toxicable, we can find some corner cases where this will introduce breaking changes. The same was true for #10412 and it seems it didn't bother much people.\r\n\r\n## Other information", "created_at": "2017-09-07T22:18:52Z", "updated_at": "2018-07-30T21:38:43Z", "close_at": null, "merged_at": null}, {"id": 139008882, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/pulls/19011", "number": 19011, "state": "open", "title": "Fix styling dynamically created components in ViewEncapsulation.Emulated mode", "body": "## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n```\r\n[x] Bugfix\r\n[ ] Feature\r\n[ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n[ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n[ ] Build related changes\r\n[ ] CI related changes\r\n[ ] Documentation content changes\r\n[ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n[ ] Other...

This enables faster test execution for some test cases. For example, a large spec for a complex component that we developed in our company, test execution time was reduced from 45 seconds to 3.5 seconds.\r\n\r\nFor complex components, we often perform some action in beforeEach and then have many \"it\" that only test expectations. Today, we need to reexecute the test for every it, although that would not be necessary. The alternative would be to move all expectations to a single \"it\". However, this would make it much harder to analyze why a test fails. The test would result in a failure after the first failed expectation, and we would not be able to see if the other expectations also failed or if they would have executed successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce a breaking change?\r\n```\r\n[ ] Yes\r\n[x] No\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n", "created_at": "2017-06-22T19:43:56Z", "updated_at": "2018-07-30T21:38:34Z", "close_at": null, "merged_at": null}, {"id": 126817934, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/pulls/17664", "number": 17664, "state": "open", "title": "[WIP]docs(aio): add GraphQL doc", "body": "## PR Checklist\r\nDoes please check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [x] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n```\r\n[ ] Bugfix\r\n[ ] Feature\r\n[ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n[ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n[ ] Build related changes\r\n[ ] CI related changes\r\n[x] Documentation content changes\r\n[ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n[ ] Other...
